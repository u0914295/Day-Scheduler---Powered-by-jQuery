# Day Scheduler - Powered by jQuery

## Description
This project showcases the culmination of the HTML and CSS knowledge I've learned with the use of jQuery to power the app instead of JavaScript. Clicking on one of the hour blocks will let you type in information about an event that is planned to occur during that allocated time. You can then save the information for that time slot

## Visuals
The following screenshot shows a preview of the website's functionality. Clicking on one of the three section names within the Navigation Bar will auto-scroll you to that specific section of the portfolio.
<div align="center">

</div>

## Installation
Click on an individual section in the top navigation bar to auto-scroll to that specific section of the website. Click on the image under a specific project to be directed to a live URL of that specific application. To contact me, fill out the form under the "Contact Me" section with your first name, last name, and message. Remember to click the "Submit" button when finished.

## Usage
A a website portfolio example/template that can easily showcase your web development projects to future possible employers. Edit the associated HTML file to replace the individualized information with your own. Edit the associated CSS file to customize the application's appearance to your own preference.
