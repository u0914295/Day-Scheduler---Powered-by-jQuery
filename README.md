# Day Scheduler - Powered by jQuery

## Description
This project showcases the culmination of the HTML and CSS knowledge I've learned with the use of jQuery to power the app instead of JavaScript. Clicking on one of the hour blocks will let you type in information about an event that is planned to occur during that allocated time. You can then save the information for that time slot by pressing the blue "save" button. Time slots/events that have already occurred based on the current time of day will appear red while time slots/events that have yet to occur will appear green.

## Installation
Click on the web application link here and follow the instructions listed above in the description: https://u0914295.github.io/Day-Scheduler---Powered-by-jQuery/

## Usage
A day scheduler that can be easily used to add events into hour-segmented time slots throughout a 24-hour day. Simply add an event in one of the hour-long time slots, press "save", and more effectively plan your day out in addition to being able to better manage your time.
